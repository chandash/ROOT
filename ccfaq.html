Problem 
This technote explains how to manually uninstall IBM. Rational. ClearCase. from a Sun. Solaris. server by removing the installed binaries and start-up scripts.  
  
Solution 
The instructions for this process are specific to the ClearCase version installed. 

For ALL ClearCase versions: 

============================ 

1. Log in as root 

2. Stop ClearCase services (/usr/atria/etc/atria_start stop) -- VERY IMPORTANT! 

3. Backup the /var/adm/atria directory 

4. Make sure that any customizations (such as trigger scripts or a modified atria_start) made in the /usr/atria path are backed up 

5. Remove the /view directory (ClearCase services MUST be stopped before this in done!!) 


ClearCase 4.2 through 2002.05.00: 

============================

6. Rename (or remove) the ClearCase files in the start-up directories 

mv /etc/init.d/atria /etc/init.d/old.atria 
mv /etc/rc2.d/S77atria /etc/rc2.d/old.S77atria 
mv /etc/rc0.d/K35atria /etc/rc0.d/old.K35atria


7. Remove the install directory (by default stored in /usr/atria)

cd /usr
rm -rf atria

8. Remove the adm directory (by default stored in /var/adm/atria)

cd /var/adm
rm -rf atria

9. Reboot the server.



ClearCase 2003.06.00 

============================ 

6. Rename (or remove) the ClearCase files in the start-up directories 

mv /etc/init.d/clearcase /etc/init.d/old.clearcase 
mv /etc/rc2.d/S77clearcase /etc/rc2.d/old.S77clearcase 
mv /etc/rc0.d/K35clearcase /etc/rc0.d/old.K35clearcase


7. Remove the install directory (by default stored in /opt/rational/clearcase)

cd /opt/rational/
rm -rf clearcase

8. Remove the adm directory (by default stored in /var/adm/rational/clearcase)

cd /var/adm/rational/
rm -rf clearcase

9. Reboot the server.

ClearCase is now completely de-installed from the system.
