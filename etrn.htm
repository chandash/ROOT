System Administration Commands                           etrn(1M)

<H2>NAME</H2>
     etrn - start mail queue run

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
     etrn [-v] <CITE>server</CITE>-<CITE>host</CITE> [<CITE>client</CITE>-<CITE>hosts</CITE>]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
     SMTP's ETRN command allows an  SMTP  client  and  server  to
     interact, giving the server an opportunity to start the pro-
     cessing of its queues for messages to go to  a  given  host.
     This  is meant to be used in start-up conditions, as well as
     for mail nodes that have transient connections to their ser-
     vice providers.

     The etrn utility initiates an SMTP  session  with  the  host
     <CITE>server</CITE>-<CITE>host</CITE>  and sends one or more ETRN commands as follows:
     If no <CITE>client</CITE>-<CITE>hosts</CITE> are specified, etrn looks up  every  host
     name  for  which  <A href="http://bama.ua.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi?sendmail+1M">sendmail(1M)</A>  accepts  email and, for each
     name, sends an ETRN command with that name as the  argument.
     If  any  <CITE>client</CITE>-<CITE>hosts</CITE> are specified, etrn uses each of these
     as arguments for successive ETRN commands.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>
     The following option is supported:

     -v    The normal mode of operation for etrn is to do all  of
           its  work  silently.   The -v option makes it verbose,
           which causes etrn to display  its  conversations  with
           the remote SMTP server.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>
     No  environment  variables  are  used.  However,  at  system
     start-up,  /etc/init.d/sendmail reads /etc/default/sendmail.
     In  this  file,  if  the   variable   ETRN_HOSTS   is   set,
     /etc/init.d/sendmail  parses  this variable and invokes etrn
     appropriately. ETRN_HOSTS should be of the form:

     "s1:c1.1,c1.2        s2:c2.1 s3:c3.1,c3.2,c3.3"

     That is, white-space separated groups of <CITE>server</CITE>:<CITE>client</CITE> where
     <CITE>client</CITE> can be one or more comma-separated names. The :<CITE>client</CITE>
     part is optional. <CITE>server</CITE> is the name of the server to  prod;
     a  mail queue run is requested for each <CITE>client</CITE> name. This is
     comparable to running:

     /usr/lib/sendmail -qR <CITE>client</CITE>

     on the host <CITE>server</CITE>.

System Administration Commands                           etrn(1M)

     Inserting the line:

     ETRN_HOSTS="s1.domain.com:clnt.domain.com s2.domain.com:clnt.domain.com"

     in  /etc/default/sendmail  results  in  /etc/init.d/sendmail
     invoking  etrn  such  that  ETRN  commands  are sent to both
     s1.domain.com   and   s2.domain.com,   with   both    having
     clnt.domain.com as the ETRN argument.

     The line:

     ETRN_HOSTS="server.domain.com:client1.domain.com,client2.domain.com"

     results   in   two   ETRN    commands    being    sent    to
     server.domain.com, one with the argument client1.domain.com,
     the other with the argument client2.domain.com.

     The line:

     ETRN_HOSTS="server1.domain.com server2.domain.com"

     results in set  of  a  ETRN  commands  being  sent  to  both
     server1.domain.com and server2.domain.com; each set contains
     one ETRN command for each host name for  which  <A href="http://bama.ua.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi?sendmail+1M">sendmail(1M)</A>
     accepts email, with that host name as the argument.
