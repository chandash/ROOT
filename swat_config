Samba is already included on Solaris 10 installation.
On Solaris 3/05 is 3.0.4
On Solaris 1-06 is 3.0.11

You only have to configure the one is already there, this is what I did and it works for me:

For SAMBA 3.0.4 or 3.0.11

a) Configuration file (if it does not exist, create it):
#/etc/sfw/smb.conf

b) To determine the version of Samba installed, the following command can be run:
#/usr/sfw/sbin/smbd -V

c) Create folder and adjust permissions: (e.g.)
#mkdir /disk2
chmod 777 /disk2
chmod +t /disk2
chown sys /disk2
chgrp sys /disk2

d) Sample smb.conf file:

[global]
workgroup = WORKGROUP
security = SHARE
preferred master = No
local master = No
domain master = No
ldap ssl = no
hosts allow = localhost, myPC, 192.168.1.
hosts deny = All

[utility]
comment = Utilities to re-build
path = /utility
read only = No
guest ok = Yes

[disk2]
comment = Disk 2 storage
path = /disk2
read only = No
guest ok = Yes

[disk1]
comment = Disk 1 storage
path = /disk1
read only = No
guest ok = Yes

[respaldo]
comment = Backup
path = /backup
read only = No
guest ok = Yes
browseable = No

e) To test configuration:
# /usr/sfw/bin/testparm

f) Edit /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf

* For /etc/services, after the line which reads:

ldaps 636/udp # LDAP protocol over TLS/SSL (was sldap)

insert the line:
swat 901/tcp # Samba swat

* For /etc/inetd.conf add the following 2 lines to the end of the file:

Solaris 10:
netbios-ssn stream tcp nowait root /usr/sfw/sbin/smbd smbd
swat stream tcp nowait root /usr/sfw/sbin/swat swat

* NOTE: Use ?tabs? for spaces.

To connect to Swat, simply start your Web browser and point it at: http://localhost:901
You can edit your smb.conf file from within the web browser.

( Note: You will receive the following error message on ?dmesg?:

Configuration file /etc/inet/inetd.conf has been modified since inetconv was last run.
"inetconv -i/etc/inet/inetd.conf" must be run to apply any changes to SMF

Just run:
# inetconv -i/etc/inet/inetd.conf
on a terminal window.)

Tht's it, it works out of the box with no hasle, configue you smb.conf to your needs, this is just a home sample I use.

Cheeres.
