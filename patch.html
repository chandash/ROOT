<P>Patches are identified by unique alphanumeric strings with the patch base 
code first, a hyphen, and a number that represents the patch revision number. 
For example, patch 101977-02 is a Solaris 2.4 patch to correct the 
<TT>lockd</TT> daemon. 101988 is the number for the <TT>lock</TT> daemon patch. 
“-02” indicates that this is the second release of the patch.</P>
<H3><A name=Heading7></A><FONT color=#000077>Installing a Patch</FONT></H3>
<P>When you install a patch, the <TT>patchadd</TT> command copies files from the 
patch directory to a local system disk. The <TT>patchadd</TT> command does the 
following:</P>
<DL>
  <DD><B>•</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Determines the Solaris version number of the managing 
  host and the target host. 
  <DD><B>•</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Updates the <TT>pkginfo</TT> file of the patch package 
  with information about patches that are rendered obsolete by the patch being 
  installed, other patches required by this patch, and patches that are 
  incompatible with this patch. </DD></DL>
<P>During patch installation, the <TT>patchadd</TT> command keeps a log of the 
patch installation in 
<TT>/var/sadm/patch/</TT><TT><I>patch-number</I></TT><TT>/log</TT> for the 
Solaris 2.4 and earlier operating environments. The Solaris 2.5 and 2.6 releases 
also store log files in this location, but only in the event of installation 
errors.</P>
<P>The <TT>patchadd</TT> command does not install a patch under the following 
conditions:</P>
<DL>
  <DD><B>•</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The package is not fully installed on the host. 
  <DD><B>•</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The patch architecture differs from the system 
  architecture. 
  <DD><B>•</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The patch version does not match the installed package 
  version. 
  <DD><B>•</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A patch is already installed with the same base code 
  and a higher version number. 
  <DD><B>•</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The patch is incompatible with another, already 
  installed patch. (This information is stored in the <TT>pkginfo</TT> file for 
  each patch.) 
  <DD><B>•</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The patch being installed requires another patch that 
  is not installed. </DD></DL>
<P>The following example installs a patch to a standalone system: </P><!-- CODE SNIP //--><PRE><B># patchadd /var/spool/patch/104945-02</B>
</PRE><!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>The following example installs a patch to a client system, <TT>client1</TT>, 
from the server's console:</P><!-- CODE SNIP //--><PRE><B># patchadd -R /export/root/client1 /var/spool/patch/104945-02</B>
</PRE><!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>The following example installs a patch to a service from the server's 
console: </P><!-- CODE SNIP //--><PRE><B># patchadd -S Solaris_2.3 /var/spool/patch/104945-02</B>
</PRE><!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>The following example installs multiple patches in a single <TT>patchadd</TT> 
invocation:</P><!-- CODE SNIP //--><PRE><B># patchadd -M /var/spool/patch 104945-02 104946-02 102345-02</B>
</PRE><!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>The following example installs multiple patches, specifying a file that 
contains the list of patches to install: </P><!-- CODE SNIP //--><PRE><B># patchadd -M /var/spool/patch patchlist</B>
</PRE><!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>The following example installs multiple patches to a client and saves the 
backout data to a directory other than the default: </P><!-- CODE SNIP //--><PRE><B># patchadd -M /var/spool/patch -R /export/root/client1
 -B/export/backoutrepository 104945-02 104946-02 102345-02</B>
</PRE><!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>The following example installs a patch to a Solaris 2.6 or later Net Install 
Image: </P><!-- CODE SNIP //--><PRE><B># patchadd -C /export/Solaris_2.6/Tools/Boot /var/spool/patch/104945-02</B>
</PRE><!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>The following example installs a patch to a Solaris 2.6 or later Net Install 
Image, but instructs the <TT>patchadd</TT> command not to save copies of files 
that are updated or replaced:</P><!-- CODE SNIP //--><PRE><B># patchadd -d /export/Solaris_2.6/Tools/Boot /var/spool/patch/104945-02</B>
</PRE><!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<P>When you remove, or back out, a patch, the <TT>patchrm</TT> command restores 
all files modified by that patch, unless any of the following are true:</P>
<DL>
  <DD><B>•</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The patch was installed with <TT>patchadd</TT> 
  <TT>-d</TT>, which instructs <TT>patchadd</TT> not to save copies of files 
  that are updated or replaced. 
  <DD><B>•</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The patch has been obsoleted by a later patch. 
  <DD><B>•</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The patch is required by another patch. </DD></DL>
<P>The <TT>patchrm</TT> command calls <TT>pkgadd</TT> to restore packages that 
were saved from the initial patch installation.</P>
<P>During the patch installation, <TT>patchrm</TT> keeps a log of the patch 
installation in <TT>/tmp/backoutlog.</TT><TT><I>pid</I></TT>. This log is 
removed if the patch backs out successfully.</P>
<P>The following example removes a patch from a standalone system:</P><!-- CODE SNIP //--><PRE><B># patchrm 104945-02</B>

<P>The following example removes a patch from a client's system from the

<pre>Here is the complete set of error codes.

Exit code Meaning 
0 No error 
1 Usage error 
2 Attempt to apply a patch that's already been applied 
3 Effective UID is not root 
4 Attempt to save original files failed 
5 pkgadd failed 
6 Patch is obsoleted 
7 Invalid package directory 
8 Attempting to patch a package that is not installed 
9 Cannot access /usr/sbin/pkgadd (client problem) 
10 Package validation errors 
11 Error adding patch to root template 
12 Patch script terminated due to signal 
13 Symbolic link included in patch 
14 NOT USED 
15 The prepatch script had a return code other than 0. 
16 The postpatch script had a return code other than 0. 
17 Mismatch of the -d option between a previous patch install and the current one. 
18 Not enough space in the file systems that are targets of the patch. 
19 $SOFTINFO/INST_RELEASE file not found 
20 A direct instance patch was required but not found 
21 The required patches have not been installed on the manager 
22 A progressive instance patch was required but not found 
23 A restricted patch is already applied to the package 
24 An incompatible patch is applied 
25 A required patch is not applied 
26 The user specified backout data can't be found 
27 The relative directory supplied can't be found 
28 A pkginfo file is corrupt or missing 
29 Bad patch ID format 
30 Dryrun failure(s) 
31 Path given for -C option is invalid 
32 Must be running Solaris 2.6 or greater 
33 Bad formatted patch file or patch file not found 
34 The appropriate kernel jumbo patch needs to be installed 

What we see from this is that the error codes we saw (2 and 8) mean that either a patch was already installed or that the patch was irrelevant.

Sometimes you will see more serious errors. The most common of the serious errors is code 5 which means that the internal run of pkgadd failed. You should check the detailed log file /var/sadm/install_data/Solaris_2.6_Recommended_log for the reasons.

It is not necessary to reboot the system immediately after installation but the system does need to be rebooted before any kernel or libc patches can take effect.
